# Module-5-APIs-Challenge

#From Weekly Module Overview E-mail

In this assignment, I used what I've learned this week to evaluate the performance among various algorithmic, hedge and mutual fund portfolios and compare them against the S&amp;P 500 Index. 
In this module, I learned how to use Pandas and the JupyterLab IDE to collect, prepare, and analyze financial data.

## 1. A Whale off the Port(folio)

##From Module 4 Challenge Info

I have been investing in algorithmic trading strategies. Some of the investment managers love them, some hate them, but they all think their way is best.
I've just learned these quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas and I want to determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas:volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.
I need to create a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. I will be given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios offamous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. I will then use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compareits performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market [S&P 500 Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P/TSX_60).
