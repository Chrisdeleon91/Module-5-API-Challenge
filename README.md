# Module-5-APIs-Challenge

In this assignment, I will use the information from the Monte Carlo simulation to answer questions about the portfolio in my Jupyternotebook.
In this module, I learned how to measure and analyze long-term future performance using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Monte Carlo simulations.

I have decided to start a fintech consulting firm that focuses on projects to benefit local communities. I've just won my first contract with a large credit union. The project entails building a tool to help credit union members evaluate their financial health. Specifically, the credit union board wants the members to be able to do two things. First, they should be able to assess their monthly budgets. Second, they should be able to forecast a reasonably effectiveretirement plan based on their current holdings of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. The chief technology offi cer(CTO) of the credit union wants me to develop a prototype application to present at its next assembly.

What I'm Creating
I'll need create two financial analysis tools with a single Jupyter notebook:
1. A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.
  
2. A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in MonteCarlo simulations. I'll use the information from the Monte Carlo simulation to answer questions about the portfolio in my Jupyternotebook.

* Create a Financial Planner for Emergencies
  * Evaluate the Cryptocurrency Wallet by Using the Requests Library
  * Evaluate the Stock and Bond Holdings by Using the Alpaca SDK
  * Evaluate the Emergency Fund
* Create a Financial Planner for Retirement
  * Create the Monte Carlo Simulation
  * Analyze the Retirement Portfolio Forecasts
  * Forecast Cumulative Returns in 10 Years

## Instructions on how to use 

### 1. Launch whale_analysis.ipynb from JuypterLab
* Run through each line of code to view the output
